apwlib
========================================

This `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ package contains code that has been 
useful for my own research, but I believe is extensible to many other projects
across a variety of disciplines. I am happy to collaborate on new additions to
the package, as well as share code and algorithms with anyone interested. See 
for example: `Open Science <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research>`_

To install, use the standard:
    python setup.py install
    
Any questions can be directed to me via email at adrn at astro.columbia.edu
