========================================

This `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ package contains code that has been 
useful for my own research, but I believe is extensible to many other projects
across a variety of disciplines. I am happy to collaborate on new additions to
the package, as well as share code and algorithms with anyone interested. See 
for example: `Open Science <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research>`_.

To install, use the standard
::
    python setup.py install

For help and examples, see the examples/ path within the project.

1_coordinates.py
    contains some examples of how to create and use the coordinate 
    system tools such as:
        - Test1
        - Test2

2_astrodatetime.py
    demonstrates how to use the Python datetime.datetime() subclass
    called astrodatetime() to handle JD/MJD and Sidereal Time.
        - Test1
        - Test2

Any questions can be directed to me via email at **adrn at astro.columbia.edu**
